        <p class="introduction__p">
          The Ceo, Christophe Plantin, was born in the region of Tours, France. His exact birth date is unknown, but
          most
          likely
          somewhere around 1520. <span class="p__emphasis">His early years are vague</span> . His parents died when he
          was
          15—leaving him all alone in France
          without any money. He turned to learning bookbinding and met his future wife, Jeanne Rivière.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction__p">
          They had five daughters together. In France, they quickly realised they had no chance of making it big in this
          country.
          To successfully fulfil his dream of becoming a printer, he moved to Antwerp, <span class="p__emphasis"> where
            the
            story of his printing empire
            started</span>.

          A business guide written by a poor businessman is worth nothing. Plantin has extensive experience in the
          business
          industry; <span class="p__emphasis"> his qualifications are no joke </span>. While he has had many ups and
          downs,
          his glory days in 1568 and 1572
          prove he
          is capable as a businessman.
        </p>
        <p class="achievements__p">
          He had to start over from scratch nearly three times, but in the end, he built a successful empire that lasted
          nine long
          generations and was the <span class="p__emphasis"> leading business in the field of printing for over 300
            years</span>.

          At its most successful time, his company had 22 presses and more than 80 employees. Under all these employees
          was a
          group of printers, compositors, proofreaders and various servants. Together, they helped Plantin print as many
          books as
          possible. No other printing company had as many presses as him, with even the most famous printing houses at
          the
          time
          not having more than four. The scale of his business was gigantic.

            How he brought it this far is no mystery; his business techniques are straightforward and understandable. Do
            keep
            in
            mind that while these techniques helped build his company to the heights it achieved, the most important
            part
            of
            his
            business might have been "Labore et Constantia”, the motto of his business and life. He could not have

            to
            make
            it this big had he not pushed through in hard times and continued working even then.

          age of
          four, his daughters learned to read and write, a necessary skill for working in his printing company. When

            When he moved his whole family from France to Antwerp, he didn't just throw a dart at a map and hope for the

            No,
            Antwerp was a strategically chosen city. At the time, Trade in Antwerp was booming. Thanks to the
            internationally
            well-used port, the city was flourishing. Many artists and entrepreneurs from all over Europe came to
            Antwerp,

            Plantin tried to sell as many books as possible. One way he did this was by catering to as many different
            people
            as
            possible. He targeted both the rich and the poor. One of the big differences between his cheaper books and
            the
            most
            expensive books was in the images. Plantin had perfected using either etchings or woodblocks to print the
            illustrations
            in his books.
          </p>
          <p class="colour__p">
            However, no matter which technique he used, he could still only print in black or red. This meant that if he
            wanted
            coloured illustrations, he had to hire a painter to colour the illustrations for him. And thus, only the
            rich
            could have
            the privilege of buying a book with coloured illustrations.

          Plantin also encountered a few pitfalls during his many years of running his business that any business owner
          should try
          to avoid. These next things are better avoided to avoid endangering your business with bankruptcy.

                  Something that should be avoided is what happened to Plantin when he was away on business in France.
                  During a
                  raid
                  on
                  his shop, a Calvinistic pamphlet was discovered. No matter if Plantin was the person who printed it or
                  not,
                  his
                  whole
                  company was publicly sold.

                his

            Christophe Plantin built a very lucrative business and continually invested more work and money back into
            the
            business.
            There is no better businessman to teach you the ins and outs of how to manage a printing business.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to see his company for yourself, pay a visit to the Plantin-Moretus museum and see how much of
            his
            company
            is left after 300 years. Learn more about how his son managed the business and see the books that were
            printed
            on his
            orders.
