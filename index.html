    <p class="introduction__p">
      The Ceo, Christophe Plantin, was born in the region of Tours, France. His exact birth date is unknown, but most
      likely
      somewhere around 1520. <span class="p__emphasis">His early years are vague</span> . His parents died when he was
      15—leaving him all alone in France
      without any money. He turned to learning bookbinding and met his future wife, Jeanne Rivière.
    </p>
    <p class="introduction__p">
      They had five daughters together. In France, they quickly realised they had no chance of making it big in this
      country.
      To successfully fulfil his dream of becoming a printer, he moved to Antwerp, <span class="p__emphasis"> where the
        story of his printing empire
        started</span>.

    <p class="achievements__p">
      A business guide written by a poor businessman is worth nothing. Plantin has extensive experience in the business
      industry; <span class="p__emphasis"> his qualifications are no joke </span>. While he has had many ups and downs,
      his glory days in 1568 and 1572
      prove he
      is capable as a businessman.
    </p>
    <p class="achievements__p">
      He had to start over from scratch nearly three times, but in the end, he built a successful empire that lasted
      nine long
      generations and was the <span class="p__emphasis"> leading business in the field of printing for over 300
        years</span>.

        At its most successful time, his company had 22 presses and more than 80 employees. Under all these employees
        was a
        group of printers, compositors, proofreaders and various servants. Together, they helped Plantin print as many
        books as
        possible. No other printing company had as many presses as him, with even the most famous printing houses at the
        time
        not having more than four. The scale of his business was gigantic.

      How he brought it this far is no mystery; his business techniques are straightforward and understandable. Do keep
      in
      mind that while these techniques helped build his company to the heights it achieved, the most important part of
      his
      business might have been "Labore et Constantia”, the motto of his business and life. He could not have managed to
      make
      it this big had he not pushed through in hard times and continued working even then.

    <p class="family__p">If you want to set up a business, you need employees. Preferably, people who will stay loyal to
      you and won't ask
      for
      too much money. Plantin quickly realised that the best employees were right there, his five daughters. From the
      age of
      four, his daughters learned to read and write, a necessary skill for working in his printing company. When they
      had
      mastered reading in all languages, they were set up as proofreaders.

        This job didn't require them to understand what they were reading, just being able to read and notice when

      When he moved his whole family from France to Antwerp, he didn't just throw a dart at a map and hope for the best.
      No,
      Antwerp was a strategically chosen city. At the time, Trade in Antwerp was booming. Thanks to the internationally
      well-used port, the city was flourishing. Many artists and entrepreneurs from all over Europe came to Antwerp, now
      the
      mercantile hub of Europe.
      <br><br>
      Antwerp was the place to be for starting a new business. Plantin took advantage of this and set up his printing
      business.

      Plantin tried to sell as many books as possible. One way he did this was by catering to as many different people
      as
      possible. He targeted both the rich and the poor. One of the big differences between his cheaper books and the
      most
      expensive books was in the images. Plantin had perfected using either etchings or woodblocks to print the
      illustrations
      in his books.
    </p>
    <p class="colour__p">
      However, no matter which technique he used, he could still only print in black or red. This meant that if he
      wanted
      coloured illustrations, he had to hire a painter to colour the illustrations for him. And thus, only the rich
      could have
      the privilege of buying a book with coloured illustrations.

      whole
      company was publicly sold.

      He had no choice but to stay in Paris until his name was cleared, lest he be executed. And upon his return, all
      his

      stuff were
      his friends willing to collaborate with him.
